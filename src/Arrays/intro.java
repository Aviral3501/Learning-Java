         * IN java -->
         * 1)Objects are created in heap
         * 2)Heap may or may not be contiguous
         * Hence array in java may or may not be contiguous
         * Java completely depends on JVM for the allocation of memory space

//        In Java, arrays are contiguous in the sense that their elements are stored in consecutive memory locations. However, the misunderstanding
//        may arise due to the fact that arrays in Java are objects, and when it comes to objects, the elements themselves are not stored directly
//        in the array, but rather, references to objects are stored.


//        So, while the array itself is a contiguous block of memory, the elements within the array (especially for objects) might be scattered in
//        different parts of the memory, depending on where the objects are dynamically allocated. This contrasts with languages like C or C++, where
//        arrays of objects store the actual objects in contiguous memory locations. Java's approach allows for better memory management and flexibility
//        but introduces a layer of indirection through object references.
